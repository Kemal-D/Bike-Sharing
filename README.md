# Bike Sharing Demand

For my master's thesis I looked at bike sharing demand before and during Covid-19 in the Netherlands, more spesifically Amsterdam.
Before starting to collect data, to test my hypothesis, I used publicly available public bike sharing data from US to see if there is indeed a difference between in demand before and during Covid-19.
